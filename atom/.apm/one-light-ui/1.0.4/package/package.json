Icons by [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons).\n\n### Combine with other Syntax themes\n\nThere is a matching [Syntax theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-syntax), but most other Syntax themes work fine as well.\n\n![one-light-ui + sepia](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/6980110/fc59aca6-da27-11e4-963c-7ecd8400b2c0.png)\n> One light + [Sepia](https://atom.io/themes/sepia-syntax)\n\n![one-light-ui + chester](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/6980109/fb13e384-da27-11e4-8324-8d8ee2de5ad5.png)\n> One light + [Chester](https://atom.io/themes/chester-atom-syntax)\n\n### Install\n\nThis theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to the __Settings > Themes__ section and selecting \"One Light\" from the __UI Themes__ drop-down menu.\n\n### Settings\n\nIn the theme settings you can switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:\n\n1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.\n2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.\n3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.\n\nAs well as change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down.\n\n### Customize\n\nIt's also possible to resize only certain areas by adding the following to your `styles.less` (Use the DevTools to find the right selectors):\n\n```css\n.theme-one-light-ui {\n  .tab-bar { font-size: 18px; }\n  .tree-view { font-size: 14px; }\n  .status-bar { font-size: 12px; }\n}\n```\n\n### FAQ\n\n__Why do the colors change when I switch Syntax themes.__\nThis UI theme uses the same background color as the choosen Syntax theme. In case that Syntax theme has a dark background color, it only uses its hue, but otherwise stays light. This lets you use light-dark combos.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui#readme","_id":"one-light-ui@1.0.4","_shasum":"af0be07188fdfe49d0d7df89c178b44f278d09e8","_resolved":"file:../../../../d-115917-23578-tectg5/package.tgz","_from":"../../../../d-115917-23578-tectg5/package.tgz"}
