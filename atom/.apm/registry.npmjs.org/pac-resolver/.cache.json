Generates an asynchronous resolver function from a [PAC file][pac-wikipedia]\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver)\n\n\nThis module accepts a JavaScript String of code, which is meant to be a\n[PAC proxy file][pac-wikipedia], and returns a generated asynchronous\n`FindProxyForURL()` function.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install pac-resolver\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nGiven the PAC proxy file named `proxy.pac`:\n\n``` js\nfunction FindProxyForURL(url, host) {\n  if (isInNet(myIpAddress(), \"10.1.10.0\", \"255.255.255.0\")) {\n    return \"PROXY 1.2.3.4:8080\";\n  } else {\n    return \"DIRECT\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can consume this PAC file with `pac-resolver` like so:\n\n``` js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar pac = require('pac-resolver');\n\nvar FindProxyForURL = pac(fs.readFileSync('proxy.pac', 'utf8'));\n\nFindProxyForURL('http://foo.com/', 'foo.com', function (err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(res);\n    // → \"DIRECT\"\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### pac(String jsStr[, Object options]) → Function\n\nReturns an asynchronous `FindProxyForURL()` function based off of the given JS\nstring `jsStr` PAC proxy file. An optional `options` object may be passed in which\nrespects the following options:\n\n * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.\n * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the\n JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to\n include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For\n async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function\n instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were\n synchronous.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[pac-file-docs]: https://web.archive.org/web/20070602031929/http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html\n[pac-wikipedia]: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config\n","maintainers":[{"name":"tootallnate","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-22T05:29:12.430Z","created":"2013-12-09T21:44:42.130Z","0.0.1":"2013-12-09T21:44:50.924Z","0.0.2":"2013-12-30T04:36:41.433Z","1.0.0":"2014-01-08T22:17:07.171Z","1.1.0":"2014-01-25T18:52:51.513Z","1.2.0":"2014-01-28T22:27:58Z","1.2.1":"2014-04-04T18:54:18.474Z","1.2.2":"2014-05-21T05:24:29.908Z","1.2.3":"2014-11-22T20:32:17.568Z","1.2.4":"2014-11-22T20:37:05.972Z","1.2.5":"2015-02-20T20:58:07.035Z","1.2.6":"2015-02-22T05:29:12.430Z"},"author":{"name":"Nathan Rajlich","email":"nathan@tootallnate.net","url":"http://n8.io/"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver","keywords":["pac","file","proxy","resolve","dns"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-resolver/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"D54RRN3KFH7VJ38XN0I9KWEI7\""}
