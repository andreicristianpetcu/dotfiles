XmlEntities class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Entities = require('html-entities').XmlEntities;\n\nentities = new Entities();\n\nconsole.log(entities.encode('<>\"\\'&©®')); // &lt;&gt;&quot;&apos;&amp;©®\nconsole.log(entities.encodeNonUTF('<>\"\\'&©®')); // &lt;&gt;&quot;&apos;&amp;&#169;&#174;\nconsole.log(entities.encodeNonASCII('<>\"\\'&©®')); // <>\"\\'&©®\nconsole.log(entities.decode('&lt;&gt;&quot;&apos;&amp;&copy;&reg;&#8710;')); // <>\"'&&copy;&reg;∆\n```\n\n####All HTML entities encoding/decoding####\n\n\n```javascript\nvar Entities = require('html-entities').AllHtmlEntities;\n\nentities = new Entities();\n\nconsole.log(entities.encode('<>\"&©®∆')); // &lt;&gt;&quot;&amp;&copy;&reg;∆\nconsole.log(entities.encodeNonUTF('<>\"&©®∆'));

require('html-entities').AllHtmlEntities; // Synonym for HTML5 entities.\n```\n\nSupports four methods for every class:\n\n* encode — encodes, replacing characters to its entity representations. Ignores UTF characters with no entity representation.\n* encodeNonUTF — encodes, replacing characters to its entity representations. Inserts numeric entities for UTF characters.\n* encodeNonASCII — encodes, replacing only non-ASCII characters to its numeric entity representations.\n* decode — decodes, replacing entities to characters. Unknown entities are left as is.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mdevils","email":"mdevils@yandex.ru"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-18T14:48:28.315Z","created":"2013-02-15T15:08:31.052Z","1.0.0":"2013-02-15T15:08:33.911Z","1.0.1":"2013-02-15T15:13:29.309Z","1.0.2":"2013-02-20T09:14:36.442Z","1.0.3":"2013-02-20T11:32:02.907Z","1.0.4":"2013-02-20T11:34:09.463Z","1.0.5":"2013-02-20T13:35:06.581Z","1.0.6":"2013-02-20T16:52:23.002Z","1.0.7":"2013-02-20T18:08:26.029Z","1.0.8":"2013-02-21T10:43:06.556Z","1.0.9":"2013-02-21T11:12:26.425Z","1.0.10":"2013-02-23T16:39:35.580Z","1.1.0":"2014-08-18T23:05:50.705Z","1.1.1":"2014-08-28T13:21:31.251Z","1.1.2":"2015-01-12T10:11:08.776Z","1.1.3":"2015-07-18T14:48:28.315Z"},"author":{"name":"Marat Dulin","email":"mdevils@yandex.ru"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/mdevils/node-html-entities.git"},"users":{"roboterhund87":true,"radist2s":true,"mavin":true,"mightyiam":true,"alejcerro":true,"itonyyo":true,"jcottam":true,"frankymartz":true},"homepage":"https://github.com/mdevils/node-html-entities#readme","keywords":["html","html entities","html entities encode","html entities decode","entities","entities encode","entities decode"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mdevils/node-html-entities/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"1VBHLXBZHBATM0NLJ83SVZPVT\""}
