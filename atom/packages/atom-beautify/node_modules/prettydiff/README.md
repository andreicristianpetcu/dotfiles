Run with Node.js / io.js / CommonJS / RequireJS
---

Node.js and io.js support is provided by api/node-local.js.  This file can execute in the following modes:

* auto - Determine if the resource is text, a file, or a directory and process as such (except that directories are processed with the subdirectory option)
* screen - code input is on the command line and output is to the command line
* filescreen - code input is in a file and the output is to the command line
* file - the input and the output reside in files
* directory - everything in a directory is processed into a specified output directory except ".", "..", and subdirectories
* subdirectory - process the entire directory tree

**Execute in the context of a NodeJS application**

First install the prettydiff package locally

    npm install prettydiff

Add this code to your application

    var prettydiff = require("prettydiff"),
        args       = {
            source: "asdf",
            diff  : "asdd",
            lang  : "text"
        },
        output     = prettydiff.api(args);

**Execute from the command line**

First install the prettydiff package globally

    npm install prettydiff -g

Run in windows

    prettydiff source:"c:\myDirectory" readmethod:"subdirectory" diff:"c:\myOtherDirectory"

Run in Linux and OSX

    prettydiff source:"myDirectory" mode:"beautify" readmethod:"subdirectory" output:"path/to/outputDirectory"
    
To see a *man* page provide no arguments or these: help, man, manual

    prettydiff
    prettydiff help
    prettydiff man

To see only the version number supply only *v* or *version* as an argument:

    prettydiff v
    prettydiff version

Run in a web browser with api/dom.js
---

Please feel free to use prettydiff.com.xhtml file to supplement dom.js.  Otherwise, dom.js requires supplemental assistance to map DOM nodes from an HTML source.  dom.js is fault tolerant so nodes mapped to the supplied prettydiff.com.xhtml don't need to be supported from custom HTML.

To run Pretty Diff using dom.js include the following two script tags and bind the pd.recycle() function to the executing event.  Please refer to prettydiff.com.xhtml for an HTML example and documentation.xhtml for option and execution information.

    <script type="application/javascript" src="prettydiff.js"></script>
    <script type="application/javascript" src="api/dom.js"></script>

Run on Windows command line with WSH
---

Create a WSH script file using XML syntax and with a file extension of
"WSF".  This file must have a tag for each supported argument, must be
capable of reading from a file, and retrieving dependencies.

http://prettydiff.com/api/prettydiff.wsf

Pretty Diff would be executed using the following on CLI:

    cscript prettydiff.wsf
    cscript prettydiff.wsf /source:"myFile.xml" /mode:"beautify"

Execute with vanilla JS
---

    var args   = {
            source: "asdf",
            diff  : "asdd",
            lang  : "text"
        },
        output = prettydiff(args);
