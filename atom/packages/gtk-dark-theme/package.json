  "readme": "# GTK Dark Theme Variant for Atom\nA simple plugin for [Atom](http://atom.io) that enables you to toggle the [dark theme variant](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/GtkSettings.html#GtkSettings--gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme) in Atom on GTK+ 3-based desktop environments that support it. GNOME 3 is the most common shell that supports this.\n\nYou can use this to enable the dark variant of your current desktop theme for Atom windows, which results in a much more beautiful interface when using dark UI themes. Note that this currently does not affect the menu bar.\n\nThis package is inspired by and is based off of the [GTKDarkThemeVariantSetter](https://github.com/p-e-w/GTKDarkThemeVariantSetter) plugin for Sublime Text. Credit should be given to [Philipp Weidmann](http://github.com/p-e-w) for the steps to modify an open window's theme.\n\n### Before (GNOME 3):\n![Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderstephen/atom-gtk-dark-theme/master/images/before.png)\n\n### After:\n![After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderstephen/atom-gtk-dark-theme/master/images/after.png)\n\n## Installation\nVia `apm`:\n\n    apm install gtk-dark-theme\n\n## Usage\nTo enable the dark theme, open the command palette (<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+P</kbd>) and select \"Gtk Dark Theme: Enable\" from the list. To disable the dark theme, open the command palette and select \"Gtk Dark Theme: Disable\" from the list.\n\nYour current choice will be remembered the next time you open Atom.\n\n## License\nThis package is licensed under the MIT License. See [the license file](LICENSE.md) for details.\n",
