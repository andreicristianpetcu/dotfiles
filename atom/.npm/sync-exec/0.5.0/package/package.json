Synchronous file readers will start listening to these files right after. Once outputting is done, values get picked up, tmp files get deleted and values are returned to your code.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"sync-exec@0.5.0","_shasum":"3f7258e4a5ba17245381909fa6a6f6cf506e1661","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sync-exec/-/sync-exec-0.5.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sync-exec/-/sync-exec-0.5.0.tgz"}
