Good XPath](https://github.com/google/wicked-good-xpath) is a fast implementation of [document.createExpression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.createExpression) and [document.evaluate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.evaluate) ([DOM3-XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20040226/DOM3-XPath.html)) in pure Javascript.\n\nVersion\n------\n\n`x.y.z`: `x.y` refers to the Wicked Good XPath revision when `wgxpath.install.js` was built; `z` refers to any improvements to this package.\n\nI'm pretty lazy, so I don't build Wicked Good XPath myself. When the pre-compiled [wgxpath.install.js](https://github.com/google/wicked-good-xpath/releases/latest) is updated, I'll update this package.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n    npm install wgxpath\n\nMake sure things are working:\n\n    node node_modules/wgxpath/word_of_the_day.js\n\nExample\n-------\n\nThis example scrapes the [Merriam-Webster Word of the Day](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/). This code can also be found in `word_of_the_day.js`. Be sure to install jsdom 3.x before running the example.\n\n```sh\n$ npm install jsdom@\"<4\"\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar wgxpath = require('wgxpath');\nvar jsdom = require('jsdom');\n\nvar url = 'http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/';\nvar expressionString = '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[3]/ul/li[1]/strong';\n\njsdom.env({\n  html: url,\n  done: function(errors, window) {\n    wgxpath.install(window);\n    var expression = window.document.createExpression(expressionString);\n    var result = expression.evaluate(window.document,\n        wgxpath.XPathResultType.STRING_TYPE);\n    console.log('The Word of the Day is \"' + result.stringValue + '.\"');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jacobmarble","email":"jacobmarble@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-08-21T07:20:54.316Z","created":"2013-01-14T03:36:35.776Z","0.12.0":"2013-01-14T03:36:36.530Z","0.12.1":"2013-01-14T03:44:27.289Z","0.20.0":"2014-03-15T06:01:24.165Z","0.20.1":"2014-03-15T06:08:55.112Z","0.20.2":"2014-03-16T22:25:09.080Z","0.23.0":"2014-08-17T20:17:27.348Z","1.0.0":"2015-04-13T06:17:08.801Z","1.1.0":"2015-08-21T07:20:54.316Z"},"author":{"name":"Jacob Marble","email":"jacobmarble@gmail.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jacobmarble/node-wgxpath.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jacobmarble/node-wgxpath","keywords":["xpath","wgxpath","wicked-good-xpath","parse","html"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jacobmarble/node-wgxpath/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jden":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"JPFBN57L0QUCJW48RQSCTWQ1\""}
