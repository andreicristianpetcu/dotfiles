present for both `x` and `y`, the value from\n`y` will appear in the result.\n\nThe merge is immutable, so neither `x` nor `y` will be modified.\n\nThe merge will also merge arrays and array values.\n\ninstall\n=======\n\nWith [npm](http://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```\nnpm install deepmerge\n```\n\nFor the browser, you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```\nbower install
