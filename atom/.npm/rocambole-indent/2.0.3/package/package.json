Also removing `WhiteSpace` tokens that\nare at the beginning of the line to avoid mistakes.\n\n```js\n// sanitize a single node\nsanitize(node);\n// sanitize whole AST\nsanitize(ast);\n```\n\n### updateBlockComment(token)\n\nUpdates `BlockComment` `raw` value to make sure all the lines have the same\n`Indent` level.\n\nThis is called internally by the `addLevel` and `indentInBetween` methods (if\nfirst token of line is a `BlockComment`), so as long as you only use those\nmethods to edit the indent level you shouldn't need to call this.\n\n### alignComments(astOrNode)\n\nAlign all the comments based on the next/previous lines inside a given `ast` or\n`node`.\n\nIt will align the comments with the next line unless the comment block is\nfollowed by an empty line, in that case it will use the previous non-empty line\nas a reference.\n\nExample output:\n\n```js\n// aligned with next line\nswitch (foo) {\n  // aligned with next non-empty line\n\n  case bar:\n    // aligned with next line\n    baz();\n    // this should be aligned with previous line since comment block is\n    // followed by an empty line\n\n  // aligned with next line\n  case biz:\n    // aligned with next line\n    what();\n// aligned with next line\n}\n\nfunction noop() {\n  // indented since it's inside an empty block\n}\n\n// aligned with previous line since it's at the end of program\n```\n\n### whiteSpaceToIndent(token, [indentValue])\n\nConvert `WhiteSpace` token into `Indent` if it's the first token of the line.\n\nYou can pass a custom `indentValue` or it will use the value set by\n`setOptions()` to calculate the indent `level` (basically count how many times\nthis string repeats inside the `token.value`).\n\n```js\nvar token = {\n  type: 'WhiteSpace',\n  value: '\\t\\t\\t',\n  prev: { type: 'LineBreak', value: '\\n' }\n};\nwhiteSpaceToIndent(token, '\\t');\n// edits properties in place\nconsole.log(token.type);  // > \"Indent\"\nconsole.log(token.level); // > 3\n```\n\nThis is useful in case you want to make sure `sanitize` won't remove the\noriginal indents.\n\n## Debug\n\nThis module uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) internally. To\nmake it easier to identify what is wrong we sometimes run the esformatter tests\nwith a `DEBUG` flag, like:\n\n```sh\nDEBUG=rocambole:indent npm test\n```\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT License\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"rocambole-indent@2.0.3","_shasum":"fb2d257d01a0f6ebd045eb0fd3e42c4f7cac54ce","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rocambole-indent/-/rocambole-indent-2.0.3.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rocambole-indent/-/rocambole-indent-2.0.3.tgz"}
