It's *better* to write a separate tool to\n*sanitize* this info and that can be executed as a separate step.\n\nAlso important to note that right now rocambole doesn't add any reference on\nthe token itself to the nodes that contain that token, so if you remove a token\nthat happens to be the `startToken` or `endToken` of any node you might have\nsome conflict if you start manipulating the tokens based on the `nodes`,\ninstead of the `token` LinkedList. - the `node.startToken` might be *detached*\nfrom the LinkedList.\n\nTest coverage is pretty low so far, but since it was mostly extracted from\nesformatter the methods should work as expected. I started to write some tests\njust to show how I would do it but did not had the time to finish it...\n(ideally tests should be written before the implementation).\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the MIT License.\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"rocambole-token@1.2.1","_shasum":"c785df7428dc3cb27ad7897047bd5238cc070d35","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rocambole-token/-/rocambole-token-1.2.1.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/rocambole-token/-/rocambole-token-1.2.1.tgz"}
