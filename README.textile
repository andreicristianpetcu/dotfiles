@oh-my-zsh@ is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ configuration.

It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout…

bq. "OH MY ZSHELL!"

h2. Setup

@oh-my-zsh@ should work with any recent release of "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/. The minimum recommended version is *4.3.9*.

If not already installed, you can install "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ using the command-line.

h3. The automatic installer… do you trust me?

You can install this via the command-line with either @curl@ or @wget@.

h4. via @curl@:

@curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh@

h4. via @wget@:

@wget --no-check-certificate http://install.ohmyz.sh -O - | sh@

h4. *Optionally*, change the install directory:

The default location is @~/.oh-my-zsh@ (hidden in your home directory).

You can change the install directory with the @ZSH@ environment variable, either by running @export ZSH=/your/path@ before installing, or by setting it before the end of the install pipeline like this:

@curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | ZSH=~/.dotfiles/zsh sh@

h3. The manual way

1. Clone the repository:

@git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh@

2. *Optionally*, backup your existing @~/.zshrc@ file:

@cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig@

3. Create a new "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ config file by copying the "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ template we've provided:

@cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc@

4. Set "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ as your default shell:

@chsh -s /bin/zsh@

5. Start or restart "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ by opening a new command-line window.

h3. Problems?

You _might_ need to modify your @PATH@ in @~/.zshrc@ if you're not able to find some commands after switching to @oh-my-zsh@.

If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the @ZSH@ environment variable in @~/.zshrc@.

h2. Usage

* enable the plugins you want in your @~/.zshrc@ (take a look at the @plugins/@ directory and the "wiki":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins to see what's available)
** example: @plugins=(git osx ruby)@
* theme support: change the @ZSH_THEME@ environment variable in @~/.zshrc@
** take a look at the @themes/@ directory and the "wiki":https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes to see what comes bundled with @oh-my-zsh@
* & much, much more… take a look at the @lib/@ directory to see what @oh-my-zsh@ has to offer…

h2. Useful

The "refcard":http://www.bash2zsh.com/zsh_refcard/refcard.pdf is pretty useful for tips.

h3. Customization

If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in @.zsh@) in the @custom/@ directory.

If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a @*.plugin.zsh@ file in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and then enable this plugin (see '"Usage":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#usage' above).

If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with @oh-my-zsh@, create a plugin of the same name in the @custom/plugins/@ directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in @plugins/@.

h3. Updates

By default you will be prompted to check for upgrades. If you would like @oh-my-zsh@ to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you, set the following in your @~/.zshrc@:

@DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true@

To disable upgrades entirely, set the following in your @~/.zshrc@:

@DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true@

To upgrade directly from the command-line, just run @upgrade_oh_my_zsh@.

h3. Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall @oh-my-zsh@, just run @uninstall_oh_my_zsh@ from the command-line and it'll remove itself and revert you to @bash@ (or your previous "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ configuration).

h2. Help out!

I'm far from being a "Zsh":http://www.zsh.org/ expert and suspect there are many ways to improve – if you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

h3. (Don't) send us your theme (for now)!

-I'm hoping to collect a bunch of themes – you can see existing ones in the @themes/@ directory.-

We have enough themes for the time being. Please fork the project and add on in there – you can let people know how to grab it from there.

h2. Contributors

This project wouldn't exist without all of our awesome users and contributors: "view our growing list of contributors":https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/contributors

Thank you so much!
