*Please note that the vim-easytags plug-in requires my vim-misc plug-in which is separately distributed.*

Unzip the most recent ZIP archives of the [vim-easytags] [download-easytags] and [vim-misc] [download-misc] plug-ins inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is `~/.vim` on UNIX and `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` (use `:helptags ~\vimfiles\doc` instead on Windows). To get started execute `:Note` or `:edit note:`, this will start a new note that contains instructions on how to continue from there (and how to use the plug-in in general).

If you prefer you can also use [Pathogen] [pathogen], [Vundle] [vundle] or a similar tool to install & update the [vim-easytags] [github-easytags] and [vim-misc] [github-misc] plug-ins using a local clone of the git repository.
