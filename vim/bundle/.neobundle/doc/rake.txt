INTRODUCTION                                    *rake*

This plugin is designed to let you use your favorite rails.vim commands in a
plain old Ruby project.

Projects are detected by searching for a Rakefile up the directory hierarchy.
Projects without a Rakefile will also be detected if they sit inside the gem
path, making this plugin ideal for "gem open" or "bundle open".

COMMANDS                                        *rake-commands*

                                                *rake-:Rake*
:Rake [task]            Invoke |:make| followed by |:cwindow| with rake as the
                        'makeprg'.  Uses `bin/rake` if available.

                                                *rake-:Cd* *rake-:Rcd*
:Cd [directory]         |:cd| relative to the project.

                                                *rake-:Lcd* *rake-:Rlcd*
:Lcd [directory]        |:lcd| relative to the project.

                                                *rake-:A* *rake-:R*
:A [file]               With no argument, edits the "alternate" file (the test
                        for an implementation file and vice versa).  With an
                        argument, edit that file, relative to the Gem's root.

                                                *rake-:AS* *rake-:RS*
:AS [file]              Like |:A|, but horizontally split.

                                                *rake-:AV* *rake-:RV*
:AV [file]              Like |:A|, but vertically split.

                                                *rake-:AT* *rake-:RT*
:AT [file]              Like |:A|, but use a new tab.

                                                *rake-:AD* *rake-:RD*
:AD {file}              Like |:A|, but :read the file in.

                                                *rake-:Elib* *rake-:Rlib*
:Elib [file]            Edit a Ruby file under lib/, or Gemfile if no argument
                        is given.  Variants exist for :ESlib, :EVlib, :ETlib,
                        and :EDlib.

                                                *rake-:Etest* *rake-:Rtest*
:Etest [file]           Edit a test file under test/ or a spec file under
                        spec/.  Defaults to the test helper or spec helper.
                        Has the same variants as |:Elib|.

                                                *rake-:Espec* *rake-:Rspec*
:Espec [file]           Edit a spec file under spec/ or a test file under
                        test/.  Defaults to the spec helper or test helper.
                        Has the same variants as |:Elib|.  The only difference
                        between this command and |:Etest| is which gets
                        precedence when both files exist.

                                                *rake-:Etask* *rake-:Rtask*
:Etask [file]           Edit a .rake file under rakelib/, or Rakefile if no
                        argument is given.  Has the same variants as |:Elib|.

                                                *rake-:Ctags* *rake-:Rtags*
:Ctags                  Invoke ctags for the project.  Ordinarily it will
                        place the resulting tags file in the root of the
                        project, but if the directory is read only (e.g., a
                        system gem), it will be placed in a temp file instead.

                                                *g:rake_legacy*
Set g:rake_legacy to 1 to enable the old, legacy R command variants.  This
option will eventually be removed.
