AutoSave - automatically save changes to disk without having to use :w (or any binding to it) every time a buffer has been modified.
AutoSave is disabled by default, run :AutoSaveToggle to enable/disable AutoSave.
If you want plugin to be always enabled it can be done with g:auto_save option (place 'let g:auto_save = 1' in your .vimrc).
Inspired by the same feature in RubyMine text editor.
